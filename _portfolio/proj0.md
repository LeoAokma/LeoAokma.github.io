### What's undergraduate scientific research program?
The undergraduate scientific research program is a project conducted by Peking University. One that majors in science could join this program. By joining the program,
the undergraduates could get in touch with frontiers from various fields. Every attendant would be required to perform experiments for one year(specific working hours) under the guidance of a professor and corresponding graduate student. Two reports are required respectively in the midterm and the final of the research period.
